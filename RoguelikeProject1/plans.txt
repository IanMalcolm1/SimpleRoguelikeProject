TODOS:
Current:
Click to move in bresenham

Next:
Base all confirmerUI dimensions on fontsize

Later:
Remove all (or most) printf statements
Start implementing an EC model
Add player screen
Add better creatures
Better generation
Item manager like ActorManager?
Standardize UI screens?
Centered text

Eventually:
Look into lua
Add viewports for message log and basic character info
Add openable UI screens
Add save functionality

_____________________________________________________________________________________________
UI LAYOUT:
Openable (cover whole screen): Full Character Sheet, Inventory, Level Up Dialogues, Settings
Openable (small screen over map view): Use Ability, Take Items

_____________________________________________________________________________________________
GLOBAL MAP TILES:
Local map tiles would probably include vectors for the entities that inhabit them.
Also a timer value to manage regular cycling between which item/entity is shown.

Global map tiles will actually be entire local maps. Will need arrays of local maps to
account for z-levels, and a corresponding array for the buffermaps of each z-level (it would
be cool to be able to see maps of underground areas)

_____________________________________________________________________________________________
COMPONENTS:
Renderable component to include all tile location, tile image, and color values?
(don't think we'd need something dedicated to location alone)

_____________________________________________________________________________________________
GEOGRAPHIC MEMORY:
What I'm calling the system for player remembering only features of maps they've already seen,
rather than just knowing where everything is from the beginning.

Will want to add variables to keep track of the rectangle of area a player has seen. That way
we can center only that area if they zoom out without giving them unnecessary knowledge of
how large the area they're in actually is.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________
MOVEMENT:
Include diagonal directions.

Ensure multiple creatures can't occupy same tile on same turn unless one is flying.

Friendly creatures switch places, otherwise a creature gets blocked when trying to move to a
tile where another exists. Probably disallow npcs moving the player character either, only
player character moving npcs. Otherwise high potential for bad gameplay experience.

Maybe eventually include movement cost modifiers.

AI
Necessary:
- Creatures can either be hostile, wary, or passive towards other creatures (including the
  player depending on alignments and threat levels).
- Creatures should retreat when their health percentage is low compared to that of their
  current assailant/would-be victim.
- Creatures should use weapon with highest dps when attacking, potentially modified by a
  'cowardice' stat or something that weights using ranged weapons over melee ones.
- Creatures should be able to use any abilities they have.

Superfluous (maybe add in a later game):
- Have tool-wielding creatures to simulate doing work at workstations, congregate in taverns
  or around campfires in the evening, go to sleep on beds/bedrolls at night.
- Have animals to go to their dens or lairs at different times depending on their circadian
  rhythms.
- Creatures meant to guard things have a chance to fall asleep on the job
- Support for house ownership

MODULAR AI
Part 1.) Have a set of core/basic states, like idle, sleeping, attacking, and fleeing.
Part 2.) Have component states that correspond to core states and have different weights.
		 When an entity enters a main state, it immediately rolls one of the component sub-
		 states to engage in. (Also includes some default sub-states like a standing around
		 or wandering state.)
Part 3.) For entity components like inventories, just do flag checks in various functions,
		 so that we just modify possible state behaviors, rather than adding new ones.
