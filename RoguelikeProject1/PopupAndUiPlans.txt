TODO:
a.) Popups should be formatted like (or as, see below) UI screens.
b.) While I'm at it I can make a menu screen.
c.) Also tooltips could be a function inherited for all UIs (or from a PopupMaker class so I can pick and
	choose). Don't wanna do that today aswell, though. Seems like a lot of work, and I don't have descriptions
	for tiles yet, which is what it would be used for.


UISCREEN BASE CLASS:
Officially make UIScreens related. Initialization using untyped pointers to the classes they need
to depict???
